# Computer Vision project summer semester 2014 @ Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg

This project tests and evaluates different classifiers contained in the OpenCV computer vision library.

Used classifiers:

1. Cascade classifier

2. Softcascade classifier

3. LatentSVM classifier

## Evaluation
opencv_evaluate in folder evaluation is a tool to measure different features of a classifier. It runs a classifier against a set of positive samples, measuring the amount of positive hits, misses and false positives as well as the total time of calculation.
